%semedian - Compute standard error of the median, ignoring NaNs.

%  USAGE

%    s = semedian(x)
%
%    x              vector or matrix over which the error should be computed
%    dim            optionally, dimension along which to operate, default
%                   is first dimension of x different than 1
