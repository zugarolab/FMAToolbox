function s = nansem(x,dim)

%nansem - Compute standard error of the mean (SEM), ignoring NaNs.
%
%  USAGE
%
%    s = nansem(x)
%
%    x              vector or matrix over which the sem should be computed
%    dim            optionally, dimension along which to operate, default
%                   is first dimension of x different than 1
